        <p>
          Do you love talk shows but find the content a little bland and
          formulaic? Are you a little fed up of manicured celebrities promoting
          their latest ventures, sticking to pre-determined questions under
          glitzy studio lighting. If so, this podcast might be for you.
        </p>

          <strong className="highlight">
            The aim of the show is to simply make connections with and tease out
            interesting and entertaining stories from real people who have a
            particular talent, hobby or are doing interesting things in the
            world. People who are trying to make the world a little bit brighter
            or better.

        <p>
          You won't find interviews here with people who have fame, fortune or
          immense power. They already get plenty of air-time elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not a show expecting to reach a large audience and at this point
          consider it more of an open experiment - Maybe my Mum will listen? I'm
          hopeful that by sharing the show on the internet that over time it'll
          build up a tiny but like-minded audience that can help me make new
          connections and unlock access to other interesting guests and
          entertaining content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The success of the experiment will be very much reliant on the good
          will of potential guests but I reckon the world has more of this good
          will than we may think.

          Hey I'm Stuart. I'm the show's host, producer, researcher, marketing
          manager and web developer. I've got a tiny amount of podcasting
          experience from many years back when me and some friends recorded a
          show about digital photography. That said I'm defintely not a master
          of any of the roles listed above. I'm making this up as I go!
          Apologies if I make mistakes along the way.

        <p>
          The podcast is a hobby project partly inspired by my day job working
          in consulting roles. The variety of things I've worked on over the
          last 4 years has allowed me to be introduced to many interesting,
          creative, hard-working, passionate, talented people who all have
          stories to share from both their work or personal lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping to use this as a space to explore these stories in an light
          and entertaining way, learn from them and take inspiration. That's a
          lofty goal - I'll also settle for a pleasant natter over a nice cup of
          tea!
